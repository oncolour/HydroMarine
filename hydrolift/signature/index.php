            <!--<span class="price"></span>-->
            <p>An intoxicating mix of exquisite luxury and extreme performance; the C-32 SUN and C-32 SUN RR personify the spirit of Hydrolift. From the very beginning, our goal has been to erase the lines between performance and luxury and create a boat that is powerful, beautiful and functional. It is this tradition we have followed when designing the C-32 SUN, and the C-32 SUN RR in particular.</p>
            <p>
                Unleash the 1,450 horsepower and feel the rawness of the RR model come alive as the 2-stepped carbon hull steps in to do the job it is designed for.</p>
            <p>
                With less than 3 tons of dry weight, this is the fastest boat yet created by Hydrolift.</p>
            <p>
                Hold on tight. It’s time to fly.
